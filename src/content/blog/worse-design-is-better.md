Some main topics

Shopify stores are way too bloated, all the fancy plugins are net negative since loading time increases so much.
HTML-only sites imply, at minimum, two phDs
Plain-text emails seem more trustworthy than HTML emails (this may go through cycles)
Native HTML inputs are accessible and mobile-friendly out of the box, unlike ad-hoc custom react components or whatever
Hard to trust anything with a .com address these days, just bloated LLM-written garbage covered in ads.
.net and .org are still okay
Example sites: hacker news, Steve Yegge's blog, stallman.org, Knuth's site, drudge report, gutenberge.org, wikipedia, craigslist, git-scm

Video games e.g., outer wilds, indie games with pixel art, etc.

Main goal is not to be clickbaity or make small brain claim, but that you can actually infer a lot about a website's quality by its design.

And you can infer the following from a bad design:

- The site is probably not trying to sell you something.
- The author cares more about the content than the presentation.
- The author prioritizes function over form.
- You are likely dealing with a single person or small team, not a large corporation.
- The odds of the author having a PhD is significantly higher than average for unknown reasons (I can't prove this, but it seems true).
- The author is likely a programmer, not a marketer.
- If it's a popular site, it must be REALLY good, since the quality had to be 10x better than the competition to look that bad and still be popular. (reference skin in the game)
- The author likely is speaking their true thoughts - they aren't worried about pleasing advertisers, investors, or you.
- The site is probably not tracking you.

Include some bayesian conditional probability analysis here or whatever.

Provide evidence that there is no occurence of the phrase "worse design is better" on the internet yet, so this is my contribution to the "worse is better" meme.
