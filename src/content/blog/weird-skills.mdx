## Okay But Why

Look man, there's something baked into me that prevents sleep
before 3 AM. That's prime time for
[random things](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/C8r8H1UDN_Q).

Here are various party-trick-tier skills you can teach yourself
in an afternoon. They will not change your life, but they will
give you an odd sense of satisfaction.

I've personally learned all of these, so consider them vouched
for.

## Juggling

About once every five years, someone will ask, "can anyone here
juggle?" Every time this happens, my adrenaline spikes. _I've
been preparing for this moment my whole life_.

When I was about eight years old, I learned to juggle two balls
(one hand) and three balls (two hands) over one weekend. It's
fun to do with rocks while hiking.

## Catching Food in Your Mouth

One Saturday afternoon as a kid, I practiced throwing Goldfish
crackers in the air and catching them in my mouth. I've never
lost the skill. Once you get the hang of it, you can chuck food
into the air as hard as you can and catch it consistently.

I guess I was pretty bored as a kid.

## Multiplying Large Numbers in Your Head

It's actually pretty easy to multiply any random two-digit
numbers in your head. The technique probably scales up to four
digits with practice.

### Vedic System

My favorite trick is called
[Vedic Multiplication](https://www.instructables.com/Vedic-Multiplication/).

I think. There are surprisingly few sources on it.

The idea is to compute the result one digit at a time, which
minimizes the number of intermediate results you have to store
in your short-term memory.

It works in either direction, but I prefer starting from the
left, so you can say the number out loud while computing it.

#### Example: `27 × 31`

**Step 1: Layout as a grid.**

```
2 7
3 1
```

**Step 2: First digit (left × left):**  
`2 × 3 = 6`

(Hold onto this - a carry may adjust it)

**Step 3: Middle digits (cross-products):**  
`(2 × 1) + (7 × 3) = 2 + 21 = 23`

Add carry `2` to the first digit:  
`6 + 2 = 8`, middle digit is `3`.

**Step 4: Last digit (right × right):**  
`7 × 1 = 7`

**Final answer:** `837`

You can do this surprisingly fast with practice. I do it while
driving when I'm bored of podcasts.

**Side note:** if you ask ChatGPT to teach this, it will make
many errors, since it's bad at symbolic math. Speaking from
experience.

### Trachtenberg System

I prioritized learning the Vedic method because it's the most
general-purpose algorithm. But there are other methods that are
more efficient for special cases, like multiplying by 2, 3, 5,
11, 12, etc.

The most well-known is the
[Trachtenberg System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trachtenberg_system),
but I haven't learned enough of it yet to vouch for it. But it
works in O(n) instead of O(n<sup>2</sup>).

**Side note:** The story behind the Trachtenberg system is wild.
The inventor, Jakow Trachtenberg, invented it to keep his mind
occupied while imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp.

## Memorizing Long Numbers

The human brain is pretty good at remembering "real" things, but
not abstract things like numbers. But there are some mental
tricks to help.

### Mnemonic Major System

The
[Mnemonic Major System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_major_system)
is a standardized method for memorizing numbers by converting
them into words.

For example, 2.7182818284590 becomes N K T V N F D F N F R L P
S, which can be pronounced as "naked fan fight fanfare lips",
which can be easily remembered as a crazy fan charging into a
wrestling match while the announcer blasts a fanfare out of a
trumpet.

### Memory Palaces

[Memory Palaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci)
are a technique for remembering arbitrary information by
associating it with physical locations in your mind.

I used this technique to pass art history exams in college and
to memorize scripture references while serving as a Latter-day
Saint missionary.

While I was a missionary, my mission was visited by
[Jörg Klebingat](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/learn/jorg-klebingat),
(a leader in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints),
and he taught us his
[memory palace technique for memorizing scripture references](https://www.rdchdwck.com/mission_blog/Images/Mnemonic%20Booklet.pdf).

I used his method to memorize one verse from every chapter of
The Book of Mormon, which was constantly useful. I was proud of
this achievement until I learned that
[Jesus roasted the Pharisees for flaunting their memorized scriptures](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/23?lang=eng&id=p5#p5).

My Book of Mormon memory palace lasted for about 2 years with no
practice, but now I don't use it as often, so it's become a bit
fuzzy.

## Identifying Local Bug Species

I used to have severe arachnophobia. Then I became interested in
species identification. Now I get excited when I see
one.<FootnoteRef number={1} />

<Footnote number={1}>
  There is currently a spider chilling on my windowsill two feet
  away as I type this on my bed. He's been there a couple
  months. We're homies.
</Footnote>

Turns out whenever you see a bug on the sidewalk, you can just
look it up. ChatGPT is pretty helpful for this, and there are
also good sites like [BugGuide](https://bugguide.net/) or
various subreddits.

Scientific names are fun to learn, too. _Armadillidiidae_ is way
more fun to say than "roly poly."

## Rolling a Coin on Your Knuckles

All you need is a quarter and a boring meeting.

But don't practice over a hard desk, or you'll annoy everyone
around you when you drop the coin. I learned this the hard way.

## Lock Picking

Definitely the most practical skill on this list. Lock picking
sets are pretty cheap and most locks are terrifyingly easy to
pick. You'll never use a Master Lock again.

I own the
[Sparrows Spirit lock picking set](https://www.sparrowslockpicks.com/products/the-spirit-set),
which I have found to pretty good (not sponsored).

I learned how to lock pick in a Cybersecurity class in college
(yet another reason Information Systems is an underrated major).

## Vim Motions

Vim motions are a standard set of keyboard shortcuts that enable
editing text at a "higher level" than individual characters. The
basics can be learned quickly.

In essence, instead of typing like "backspace, backspace,
backspace, \<type some characters\> right right right \<type
some characters\>", you can do things like "delete current word,
jump to next word, capitalize it", etc.

Vim motions are mostly used by programmers, but IMO they benefit
anyone who writes a lot. I used vim motions while typing this
sentence. Heck, I use
[vim motions in my web browser](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en).

I'll defer to this
[article on using vim motions everywhere](https://jamierubin.net/2022/04/21/vim-mode-everywhere/),
because it says everything I would say.

### Vim Hot Take

A common argument from software engineers that haven't learned
vim motions is, "my bottleneck is not typing speed, it's
thinking speed."

Well, IDK man, my brain burns a billion clock cycles every time
I have to move my hand to the mouse and I become weirdly aware
aware of my elbow's existence. Maybe that's just me.

## Holding Your Breath For a Long Time

When you're bored you can just hold your breath for no reason.
It's free and the cops can't stop you.

I don't have any special advice for this other than just keep
doing it and you will improve. Not much to it.

## Morse Code

It takes a few months to become proficient enough to use Morse
on amateur radio (so I've been told), but the basics are easy to
learn.

Also, you can type in Morse code on Google's
[GBoard keyboard app](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/9011881?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid),
which is mildly fun.

## Binary

Actually useful for programmers, mildly amusing for anyone else.

Not ashamed to admit that I wore
[this binary watch](https://ebay.us/m/IFAY5t) every day in
junior high.
