## The Complexity Problem
There's a saying: "Smart people like complex solutions." Why? Because they can. But just because you can build a Rube Goldberg machine to open your blinds doesn't mean you should. Complexity slows down development, gives rise to more bugs, frustrates both devs and customers, and is generally the bane of a software developer's existence.

In the ever-wise words of grug:

Surprising? Not really. Any developer who has inherited another dev's "work of art" feels this on a deep level.

Every system has some unavoidable complexity. It's the nature of the beast. However, systems that exceed this "baseline" complexity aren't just overdoing it; they're doing it wrong. Consider the humble domain of [FizzBuzz](https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz/). A succinct [Python one-liner](data:text/plain;charset=utf-8;base64,aT0xO2V4ZWMoInByaW50KCdGaXp6JyooaSUzPT0wKSsnQnV6eicqKGklNT09MClvciBpKTtpKz0xOyIqMTAwKSAjIG15IGJlc3QgY29kZSBnb2xmIGF0dGVtcHQgc28gZmFy) is infinitely superior to the elaborate [FizzBuzz Enterprise Edition](https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition) because it cuts right to the chase, using only the minimal required complexity to solve the problem.

It's like the dilemma of [overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting) in machine learning: a model that’s too complex for its data will actually perform worse.

## What Does Simplicity Look Like?

It's all about radicalsimpli.city and, as a wise sage once suggested, "just using postgres for everything." 

## How Do We Achieve Simplicity?

Achieving simplicity requires significant mental effort. Counterintuitively, it is much harder to design simple solutions than complex ones.

Drawing from Melvin Conway’s gem, [*How Do Committees Invent?*](http://melconway.com/research/committees.html), we should strive to simplify the systems we design. And if we can't? Maybe it's time to reconsider that feature's importance. Of course,if it's genuinely crucial, we've got to tackle it, complexity and all.

> Let us first examine the tendency to overpopulate a design effort. It is a natural temptation of the initial designer to delegate tasks when the apparent complexity of the system approaches his limits of comprehension. This is the turning point in the course of the design. Either he struggles to reduce the system to comprehensibility and wins, or else he loses control of it. The outcome is almost predictable if there is schedule pressure and a budget to be managed.

Or, in developer speak:

>Let us first examine the tendency to **[overcomplicate]** a design effort. It is a natural temptation of the initial designer to **[add another layer of abstraction]** when the apparent complexity of the system approaches his limits of comprehension. This is the turning point in the course of the design. Either the designer struggles to reduce the system to comprehensibility and wins, or else **[the complexity demon devours your soul]**.

The philosophy of [Design by Subtraction](), brought to life by Fumito Ueda, echoes this sentiment from a game design perspective. Simplifying *enhances* software.

In short, the only way to achieve simplicity is through *aggressive complexity avoidance*. I find the following steps to be extremely useful in this pursuit:

## The Simplicity Cycle

### 1. Wrestle with Complexity
Before diving into code, grapple with that complex idea. Try to distill it, refine it, and if possible, simplify it. But please, no actual wrestling – the keyboards are watching.

### 2. If You Fail, Convince Your Project Manager to Pivot the Idea
If you still can't distill the idea, maybe it's time to have "the talk" with your PM. Break out that persuasive charm and try to convince them that their feature idea isn't truly necessary. You might say:

> This feature isn't strictly necessary to reach minimum viable functionality across common use cases.

What kind of PM could resist such eloquent business jargon?

### 3. If That Also Fails, Propose the 80/20 Solution
Ever heard of the Pareto principle? In 'grug brain' speak: "Do little, get lots." Find the simple solution that gets 80% of the job done with 20% of the effort. It’s like the design by subtraction method – start big, then shave away until you’re left with a beautiful, simple solution.

### 4. If That Fails Too, the Complexity is Unavoidable
Sometimes, despite our best efforts, we need that Rube Goldberg solution. If the complex feature really is important, you have no choice but to bite the bullet and make it complicated. But remember, if you have to go complex, do it intentionally, understanding every moving part.

## Conclusion: The Art of Simplicity
In the ever-evolving world of software development, the allure of shiny new technologies and intricate algorithms can be tempting. But as we chase after the next big thing, let's not forget the age-old wisdom: simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Remember, complexity doesn't just confuse developers; it confuses users too. Challenge yourself to embrace the elegance of simplicity. Less really is more.
